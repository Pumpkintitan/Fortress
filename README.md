# Fortress
## Strategy Overview

Fortress was made to be a pure defense bot with emphasis on rebuilding a central structure. It sends out one scrambler every turn but waits until it has at least 12 bits to send a wave of 3 encryptors. It builds a tunnel in the middle to funnel enemy troops through and it builds defenses around that.
